This web app is an implementation of convex hull algorithm.
It draws a convex hull build using an algorithm which takes O(n) time. 
After building convex hull you can each time generate a new random point and check if it is inside or outside the convex hull. This is implemented with optimized algorithm which has O(logN) time complexity.  

Installation ▶️
